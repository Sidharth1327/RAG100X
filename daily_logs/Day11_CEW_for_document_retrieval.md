## 🚀 Day 11 of RAG100x — Context Enrichment with Neighbor Chunks

**📅 Date:** July 30, 2025  
**🎯 Goal:** Improve retrieval quality by expanding relevant chunks with **neighboring context windows** based on original chunk indices and overlaps.

### ✅ What Was Built

- Created a utility to **retrieve top-k chunks and their surrounding neighbors**.  
- Used **chunk index metadata** to fetch adjacent chunks from the vectorstore.  
- Handled **overlap-aware concatenation** to preserve local coherence without redundancy.  
- Compared standard top-k results vs. **context-enriched responses** to assess quality gain.

### 🧠 What I Learned

- Many relevant answers are spread across **adjacent chunks**, not just isolated top-k hits.  
- Adding neighboring context helps **ground the LLM’s response** and reduces hallucinations.  
- Handling chunk overlap correctly avoids information repetition.  
- Even a **simple neighbor-padding strategy** can offer noticeable improvements in output quality.

### 📊 Key Results

| Scenario                      | Top-k Retrieval                | Context-Enriched Retrieval            |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Chunk coherence               | May miss surrounding info      | Includes supporting context            |
| Answer grounding              | Can feel abrupt or incomplete  | Flows better with local information    |
| Implementation complexity     | Plug-and-play retriever        | Slight indexing logic added            |

### 🛠️ Stack Used

- **LangChain**, **OpenAI (GPT-4o)**, **FAISS**, **Custom context retriever**, **Colab**
