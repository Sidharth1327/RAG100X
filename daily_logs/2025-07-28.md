## 🚀 Day 9 of RAG100x — Contextual Chunk Headers (CCH)

**📅 Date:** July 28, 2025  
**📂 Notebook:** `09_contextual_chunk_headers.ipynb`  
**🎯 Goal:** Improve chunk-level retrieval by injecting lightweight contextual headers (titles + summaries) at indexing time, making each chunk more semantically meaningful and retrievable.

### ✅ What Was Built

- Developed a **CCH-based preprocessing pipeline** that adds structured headers (title + GPT-4o-generated summary) to each chunk.  
- Used **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** to chunk the document after prepending each section with its contextual metadata.  
- Leveraged **GPT-4o** for document-level summarization to inject high-level guidance into chunks.  
- Embedded the context-enriched chunks using **OpenAI Embeddings**.  
- Stored all chunks in a **FAISS vectorstore** and enabled semantic retrieval based on the enriched representations.  
- Set up a query-answering interface using LangChain's `RetrievalQA` to validate retrieval quality.

### 🧠 What I Learned

- Injecting titles and summaries into each chunk **improves grounding and retrieval precision**.  
- Even simple context like `"Title: ... Summary: ..."` boosts LLM understanding of a chunk's relevance.  
- Document-level summaries provide useful context **without increasing chunk size excessively**.  
- CCH is a **low-cost and model-agnostic** way to enhance chunk informativeness.  
- This method is complementary to other enhancements like reranking or HyDE-style expansion.

### 📊 Key Results

| Scenario                          | Without CCH                        | With CCH                             |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Flat text chunks                  | Semantically shallow and isolated  | Richer, better-grounded content      |
| Query interpretation              | Hard to disambiguate relevance     | Better matching via context cues     |
| Long or technical documents       | Harder to retrieve the right part  | Higher precision due to summaries    |
