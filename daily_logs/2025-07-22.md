## üöÄ Day 5 of RAG100x ‚Äî Propositional Chunking & Quality-Driven Retrieval

**üìÖ Date:** July 22, 2025  
**üìÇ Notebook:** `05_propositional_chunking_rag.ipynb`  
**üéØ Goal:** Implement and benchmark a production-ready RAG pipeline using propositional chunking, quality evaluation, and FAISS retrieval to improve precision and reduce hallucinations.

### ‚úÖ What Was Built

- Developed a method to generate **fine-grained propositions** from larger text chunks using an LLM (ChatGroq with llama-3.1-70b) and few-shot prompting.  
- Created a **quality grading system** for propositions, evaluating accuracy, clarity, completeness, and conciseness on a 1-10 scale.  
- Implemented automated **quality checks** with thresholds to filter out low-quality propositions before embedding.  
- Embedded the validated propositions into a **FAISS vectorstore** with Ollama embeddings for fast similarity-based retrieval.  
- Built a **baseline retrieval system** using traditional token-based chunking for comparison.  
- Ran example queries comparing **proposition-based retrieval** vs **larger chunk retrieval**, demonstrating trade-offs in precision, context, and narrative flow.  
- Summarized insights highlighting when propositional chunking is ideal (quick factual queries) versus when larger chunks work better (context-rich answers).  

### üß† What I Learned

- The power of **propositional chunking** to isolate atomic facts, improving answer precision and reducing hallucinations in RAG systems.  
- How to combine LLM structured outputs and prompting techniques for **automated proposition generation and evaluation**.  
- The importance of **quality filtering** in production to maintain factual accuracy and relevance of retrieved content.  
- Differences in retrieval **performance and user experience** when using small, precise propositions versus larger, context-rich chunks.  
- Practical use of **FAISS** for scalable vector search and how embedding model choice affects retrieval quality.  

### üìä Key Results

| Aspect                | Proposition-Based Retrieval                   | Simple Chunk Retrieval                         |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Precision             | High: Focused, direct answers                 | Medium: More context, some noise               |
| Clarity               | High: Clear and concise                       | Medium: More verbose                            |
| Contextual Richness   | Low: Minimal extra context                     | High: Preserves narrative and detail           |
| Use Case Suitability  | Best for quick factual queries                 | Best for complex, exploratory questions        |
| Efficiency           | High: Faster, targeted retrieval               | Medium: Requires more processing                |
