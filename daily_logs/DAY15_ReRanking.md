## 🚀 Day 15 of RAG100x — Cross-Encoder Reranking for Precision Retrieval

**📅 Date:** August 4, 2025  
**🎯 Goal:** Improve answer quality by reranking semantically retrieved documents using a **local cross-encoder model** that performs deep token-level relevance scoring.

### ✅ What Was Built

- Implemented a **custom `CrossEncoderRetriever`** compatible with LangChain's retriever interface.  
- Used a **FAISS vectorstore** for initial document recall based on semantic similarity.  
- Integrated a **`sentence-transformers` CrossEncoder** model to rerank the top-K results.  
- The reranker computes pairwise relevance scores between the **query** and each candidate **document chunk**.  
- Final output returns only the **most relevant reranked documents** to the LLM.

### 🧠 What I Learned

- Cross-encoders perform **deep query-document interactions** using attention mechanisms, not just cosine similarity.  
- **Local reranking** is purely CPU/GPU-bound — no async or I/O benefits.  
- Implementing both `get_relevant_documents()` and `aget_relevant_documents()` depends on your pipeline (ours is sync-only).  
- Cross-encoders **significantly boost precision**, especially when used after broad vector-based recall.  
- Useful for small to medium document sets due to reranking latency.

### 📊 Key Results

| Stage                  | Purpose                            | Trade-offs                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Vector Search (FAISS)  | Fast, broad semantic recall        | May retrieve irrelevant chunks      |
| CrossEncoder Reranker  | Deep, contextual filtering         | Slower; needs local compute         |
| Combined Pipeline      | High-precision + semantic context  | More compute-heavy but accurate     |

### 🛠️ Stack Used

- **sentence-transformers**, **FAISS**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI (GPT-4o)**, **Colab**
