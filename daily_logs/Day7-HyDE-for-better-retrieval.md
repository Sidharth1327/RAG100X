## 🚀 Day 7 of RAG100x — Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)

**📅 Date:** July 24, 2025  
**📂 Notebook:** `07_HYDE_for_better_retrieval.ipynb`  
**🎯 Goal:** Implement the HyDE technique to expand vague queries into hypothetical documents using GPT-4o, improving semantic alignment and retrieval quality.

### ✅ What Was Built

- Created a **HyDERetriever class** that wraps any vectorstore retriever with a GPT-4o-based hypothetical document generator.  
- Designed a clean **LangChain LLMChain** with a few-shot prompt template for generating pseudo-documents from queries.  
- Integrated FAISS and OpenAI embeddings for **fast and semantic similarity-based retrieval** of PDF chunks.  
- Ensured **modularity** — HyDERetriever can be plugged into any LangChain-compatible RAG pipeline.  
- Demonstrated how short queries like *"main causes of climate change"* benefit from richer pseudo-context.  
- Added a utility for **text wrapping** to keep LLM outputs readable inside notebook cells.  
- Documented key motivations, insights, and future extensions for HyDE-powered systems.

### 🧠 What I Learned

- **HyDE enhances retrieval** even without altering the retriever or chunking strategy — just by changing the *embedding input*.  
- GPT-generated hypothetical documents **bridge the abstraction gap** between short queries and dense academic content.  
- Prompt quality (few-shot examples, formatting) strongly affects the **usefulness and grounding** of the pseudo-document.  
- The technique works best when queries are vague or high-level, where keyword overlap alone fails.  
- Wrapping logic inside a custom retriever keeps things **clean, reusable, and easy to debug**.

### 📊 Key Results

| Scenario                          | Without HyDE                       | With HyDE                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Short abstract queries            | Low overlap, less relevant chunks  | Better semantic match and grounding  |
| High-context academic datasets    | Missed context, retrieval failure  | Captures broader signal, more recall |
| Plug-and-play with FAISS/Chroma   | Yes                                | Yes                                  |
