## 🚀 Day 8 of RAG100x — Hypothetical Prompt Embeddings (HyPE)

**📅 Date:** July 27, 2025  
**🎯 Goal:** Implement the HyPE technique to improve retrieval by generating and embedding hypothetical questions at indexing time, converting retrieval into a question-to-question matching task.

### ✅ What Was Built

- Developed a **HyPE-based pipeline** that generates multiple hypothetical questions per text chunk using GPT-4o.  
- Used **OpenAI embeddings** to convert those questions into vectors for similarity search.  
- Created a **FAISS vector store** that stores each chunk multiple times — once per hypothetical question embedding.  
- Set up a **retriever** that matches user queries directly with these hypothetical questions instead of raw document chunks.  
- Ensured **parallel embedding generation** with `ThreadPoolExecutor` to accelerate index creation.  
- Added support for PDF ingestion, chunking via `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, and custom preprocessing.  
- Evaluated retrieval performance with real queries like *"What is the main cause of climate change?"*

### 🧠 What I Learned

- **HyPE shifts the burden to indexing**, improving retrieval with zero runtime query overhead.  
- Embedding hypothetical questions improves **alignment between user intent and stored content**, especially when phrasing differs.  
- Indexing each chunk multiple times increases **semantic coverage**, leading to richer and more diverse retrieval.  
- FAISS handles multi-vector-per-chunk retrieval efficiently, maintaining low latency.  
- Prompt design plays a key role in generating useful and varied questions from each chunk.

### 📊 Key Results

| Scenario                          | Without HyPE                       | With HyPE                            |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Vague or short questions          | Missed key chunks or shallow recall| Retrieved deeper, more relevant context |
| Stylistic query mismatch          | Poor alignment with dense text     | Better match via question-question similarity |
| Chunk size sensitivity            | Higher impact on retrieval quality | Less critical due to diverse prompts |

### 🛠️ Stack Used

- **LangChain**, **GPT-4o (ChatOpenAI)**, **PromptTemplate**, **FAISS**, **OpenAI Embeddings**, **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**, **Colab**, **ThreadPoolExecutor**, **PyPDFLoader**
