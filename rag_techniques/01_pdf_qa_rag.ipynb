        "- **`langchain-community`** – Core LangChain tools used for document loading, chunking, retrieval, etc.\n",
        "- **`langchain_openai`** – Lets LangChain work with OpenAI embeddings and models.\n",
        "- **`rank_bm25`** – Adds support for traditional keyword-based retrieval as a baseline method.\n",
        "- **`faiss-cpu`** – Enables fast similarity search over document embeddings (vector database).\n",
        "- **`deepeval`** – To evaluate how well the RAG system is retrieving and answering.\n",
