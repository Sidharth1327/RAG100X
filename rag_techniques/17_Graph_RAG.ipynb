    "## 📦 What each import is for (and what happens under the hood)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph & Traversal\n",
    "- `networkx as nx`  \n",
    "  Builds and manipulates the **knowledge graph**. Under the hood, it stores nodes/edges in efficient graph structures and provides algorithms (shortest path, centrality). In GraphRAG, you’ll:\n",
    "  - Create **nodes** = text chunks,\n",
    "  - Create **edges** = relationships (shared concepts, similarity),\n",
    "  - Store **weights** = strength of relationships,\n",
    "  - Traverse with a **priority queue** (Dijkstra-like logic).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Retrieval & LLM (LangChain + OpenAI)\n",
    "- `FAISS` (from `langchain.vectorstores`)  \n",
    "  A high-performance **similarity search** index. Internally, FAISS builds an index over embeddings so nearest neighbors can be retrieved **fast** (approximate/efficient search vs brute force).\n",
    "- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`  \n",
    "  Splits large text into **overlapping chunks** that preserve coherence (tries to split on paragraphs → sentences → chars). Overlaps keep cross-chunk continuity.\n",
    "- `PromptTemplate`  \n",
    "  Parameterized prompts for LLM calls. Keeps prompts consistent and safe.\n",
    "- `ContextualCompressionRetriever`, `LLMChainExtractor`  \n",
    "  A **two-step retriever**: first retrieve, then **shrink** content with an LLM to keep only the **most relevant lines**. Under the hood, LangChain runs an LLM prompt that *extracts salient spans* from retrieved docs.\n",
    "- `get_openai_callback`  \n",
    "  A context manager that **logs tokens & cost** per LLM call. Great for **cost control** and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ChatOpenAI` (from `langchain_openai`)  \n",
    "  LangChain’s wrapper around OpenAI chat models. Handles API calls, retries, temperature, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similarity & Math\n",
    "- `cosine_similarity` (scikit-learn)  \n",
    "  Measures **angle similarity** between embeddings (vectors). Used to:\n",
    "  - Build edges between chunks (semantic closeness),\n",
    "  - Re-rank neighbors during traversal.\n",
    "- `numpy as np`  \n",
    "  Efficient **numerical arrays** and math ops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NLP (Concepts & Normalization)\n",
    "- `nltk` + `word_tokenize`, `WordNetLemmatizer`  \n",
    "  - **Tokenization**: split text into words/tokens.\n",
    "  - **Lemmatization**: reduce words to **base forms** (e.g., “consulates” → “consulate”). This boosts **matching accuracy** when deciding if two chunks share concepts.\n",
    "- `spacy`, `English`, `spacy.cli.download`  \n",
    "  - SpaCy pipeline powers **entity detection** and **noun chunk extraction** (depending on the model you load).\n",
    "  - `English()` gives a light-weight English pipeline; to use trained models (like `en_core_web_sm`), you’ll typically `spacy.cli.download(\"en_core_web_sm\")` and then `spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")`.  \n",
    "  **Why both NLTK + spaCy?** NLTK’s lemmatizer is simple/reliable; SpaCy gives you faster tokenization, POS tags, entities. Together they help **feature extraction for edges**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Priority Queue & Parallelism\n",
    "- `heapq`  \n",
    "  Python’s **priority queue**. Critical for the **Dijkstra-like traversal**: always expand the most promising node next (highest score = strongest path to answer).\n",
    "- `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `as_completed`  \n",
    "  **Parallelize** expensive steps (embedding chunks, computing pairwise similarities, extracting concepts). This reduces preprocessing time on multi-core CPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Progress & Visualization\n",
    "- `tqdm`  \n",
    "  Nice progress bars for long loops (chunking, embedding, graph building).\n",
    "- `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `matplotlib.patches as patches`  \n",
    "  Drawing the **graph** and the **traversal path**:\n",
    "  - Nodes as dots/boxes,\n",
    "  - Edge **color/width** = weight strength,\n",
    "  - **Curved/dashed arrows** to highlight the path the algorithm actually took.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OS & Environment\n",
    "- `os`, `sys`, `dotenv.load_dotenv()`  \n",
    "  - Load **environment variables** (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) from a local `.env`.\n",
    "  - Manage file paths, optional `sys.path` tweaks.\n",
    "- `os.environ[\"KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK\"]=\"TRUE\"`  \n",

    "### Understanding the `DocumentProcessor` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DocumentProcessor` class is designed as a **utility for preparing documents** so they can be efficiently used in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Let’s break down what it does, why it does it, and what happens under the hood at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Initialization (`__init__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a `DocumentProcessor` object is created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Splitter**:  \n",
    "  It sets up a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` that breaks long documents into smaller overlapping chunks.  \n",
    "  - **Why**: Large documents cannot be directly fed into language models due to context length limits. Splitting ensures that information is captured in manageable pieces.  \n",
    "  - **Under the hood**: It recursively looks for natural breakpoints (paragraphs, sentences, punctuation). If it can’t, it falls back to raw character splits. Each chunk is about 1000 characters, with 200 characters overlapping to preserve context between chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**:  \n",
    "  It initializes `OpenAIEmbeddings`, which will later be used to convert text into high-dimensional numeric vectors.  \n",
    "  - **Why**: Text alone cannot be searched efficiently. Converting text into embeddings allows semantic similarity search.  \n",
    "  - **Under the hood**: The embedding model takes each chunk of text and maps it into a vector space (e.g., 1536 dimensions). In this space, semantically similar texts are close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `process_documents(documents)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes raw documents and makes them “search-ready.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Splitting Documents**:  \n",
    "  The text splitter breaks each document into chunks (as explained above).  \n",
    "  - Result: A list of smaller, overlapping text segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating a Vector Store (FAISS)**:  \n",
    "  Each chunk is embedded using `OpenAIEmbeddings`, and the embeddings are stored in a FAISS index.  \n",
    "  - **Why FAISS**: FAISS is a specialized library for fast similarity search over large embedding collections. Instead of scanning through every vector, FAISS uses clever indexing structures (like clustering or inverted files) to quickly find the nearest vectors.  \n",
    "  - **Under the hood**: Each embedding vector is inserted into FAISS’s internal index. Later, when you query with another embedding, FAISS computes distances and retrieves the closest matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output**:  \n",
    "  - `splits`: The list of text chunks.  \n",
    "  - `vector_store`: The FAISS index mapping those chunks to their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `create_embeddings_batch(texts, batch_size=32)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method converts a large number of texts into embeddings in smaller groups (batches).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batching**:  \n",
    "  Instead of sending all texts at once, it processes them in groups of 32 by default.  \n",
    "  - **Why**: APIs and GPU models often have limits. Batching prevents overload and makes the process more efficient.  \n",
    "  - **Under the hood**: For each batch, `embed_documents` is called, which makes an API call to the embedding model. The responses are combined into one large list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output**:  \n",
    "  A NumPy array containing all embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `compute_similarity_matrix(embeddings)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates how similar each embedding is to every other embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**:  \n",
    "  It uses cosine similarity, which measures the angle between two vectors.  \n",
    "  - **Why**: In embedding space, cosine similarity is a common metric because it focuses on direction rather than magnitude (two texts with similar meaning will point in a similar direction).  \n",
    "  - **Under the hood**: For every pair of embeddings, it computes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{similarity}(A,B) = \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| \\times ||B||}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The result is a square matrix where each cell `(i, j)` represents how similar text `i` is to text `j`.\n",

    "- **Output**:  \n",
    "  A 2D NumPy array (matrix) of similarity scores between all texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 Why This Matters for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chunking** ensures the LLM can handle large documents.  \n",
    "2. **Embeddings + FAISS** make the document collection searchable by meaning, not just keywords.  \n",
    "3. **Batch embedding** speeds up processing and avoids hitting API limits.  \n",
    "4. **Similarity matrix** helps in analyzing document relationships, clustering, or debugging retrieval quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these steps prepare raw documents so that an LLM can later **find, retrieve, and use the most relevant context** when answering questions.\n",

    "### Understanding the `QueryEngine` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `QueryEngine` class is responsible for **answering user queries** by combining:\n",
    "- **Vector search** (to fetch relevant docs quickly)  \n",
    "- **Knowledge graph traversal** (to expand context using relationships)  \n",
    "- **LLM reasoning** (to check if an answer is complete, or generate one if missing)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Initialization\n",
    "- **Vector Store** → Stores embeddings of documents for similarity search.  \n",
    "- **Knowledge Graph** → Graph of concepts & relationships between chunks.  \n",
    "- **LLM** → Used for both concept extraction and final answering.  \n",
    "- **Answer Check Chain** → A small LLM prompt that verifies if context provides a complete answer.  \n",
    "- **Max Context Length** → Keeps context within token budget.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Answer Checking (`_check_answer`)\n",
    "- Takes a **query + context**.  \n",
    "- Asks the LLM: *“Does this context fully answer the query?”*  \n",
    "- Returns:  \n",
    "  - `is_complete` (True/False)  \n",
    "  - `answer` (if complete).  \n",

    "Example:  \n",
    "> Query: \"Who wrote Hamlet?\"  \n",
    "> Context: \"Hamlet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s.\"  \n",
    "✅ Complete → Answer: \"William Shakespeare\".  \n",

    "---\n",

    "#### 3. Retrieving Relevant Documents (`_retrieve_relevant_documents`)\n",
    "- Uses the vector store to get top-k similar chunks.  \n",
    "- Compresses them with another LLM step (removes fluff).  \n",
    "- Returns a list of relevant docs to start with.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Expanding Context (`_expand_context`)\n",
    "This is the **core traversal logic**, similar to Dijkstra’s algorithm but adapted for knowledge graphs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Initialize**  \n",
    "   - Start from the most relevant nodes (from vector search).  \n",
    "   - Push them into a priority queue (priority = inverse of similarity/connection strength).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversal**  \n",
    "   - Always pick the node with **highest connection strength**.  \n",
    "   - Add its content to `expanded_context`.  \n",
    "   - Check if context now gives a complete answer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concept Handling**  \n",
    "   - Track which concepts have been “covered”.  \n",
    "   - Only expand to neighbors that introduce **new concepts**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Neighbor Expansion**  \n",
    "   - For each neighbor, calculate new priority (`1 / edge_weight`).  \n",
    "   - If this path is stronger than before, update the queue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Termination**  \n",
    "   - Stop if a **complete answer** is found.  \n",
    "   - If queue is empty but no complete answer → fallback to LLM to generate one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Query Flow (`query`)\n",
    "Full end-to-end process:\n",
    "1. **Retrieve relevant docs** via vector store.  \n",
    "2. **Expand context** by traversing knowledge graph.  \n",
    "3. **Check completeness**:  \n",
    "   - If complete → return answer.  \n",
    "   - If incomplete → LLM synthesizes final answer from expanded context.  \n",
    "4. Returns:  \n",
    "   - `final_answer`  \n",
    "   - `traversal_path` (nodes visited)  \n",
    "   - `filtered_content` (mapped node IDs → text).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 Why This Matters\n",
    "Unlike plain vector search, this approach:\n",
    "- **Understands relationships** between chunks (via graph edges).  \n",
    "- **Expands context meaningfully** (instead of just concatenating top-k).  \n",
    "- **Knows when it has enough info** (via answer check).  \n",

    "\n",
    "The **Visualizer class** provides two main functionalities:\n",
    "1. **`visualize_traversal`** → Creates a graphical visualization of the traversal path on a knowledge graph.  \n",
    "2. **`print_filtered_content`** → Prints the filtered content of the nodes that were visited during traversal, in the exact order they were explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. `visualize_traversal(graph, traversal_path)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes:\n",
    "- A **knowledge graph** (built using NetworkX).\n",
    "- A **traversal path** (a list of node IDs in the order they were visited).  \n",
    "\n",
    "It then generates a **visual flow diagram** showing:\n",
    "- Nodes.\n",
    "- Edges (with weights).\n",
    "- The exact traversal path, highlighted using red arrows.\n",
    "- Start node (highlighted in **green**) and end node (highlighted in **red**).\n",
    "- A legend and color bar for better interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-step explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize a directed graph**  \n",
    "   - Create a new directed graph (`nx.DiGraph`) and copy over all nodes + edges from the original graph.  \n",
    "   - This ensures we have a clean graph specifically for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set up the figure**  \n",
    "   - Use `matplotlib` to create a canvas (`fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 12))`).  \n",
    "   - The size ensures readability of nodes, labels, and paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Node positioning**  \n",
    "   - Generate node positions using `spring_layout`.  \n",
    "   - This layout spreads nodes out in a visually pleasing way (like magnets repelling each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Draw regular edges**  \n",

    "     Filtered Content: Einstein’s Theory of Relativity emphasizes...\n",
    "     --------------------------------------------------\n",

    "   - Only the **first 200 characters** of the content are shown (to keep output concise).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fallback if no content**  \n",
    "   - If the node has no content, prints: `\"No filtered content available\"`.\n",

    "- **For debugging**: You can see if the traversal followed the right sequence.  \n",
    "- **For learning**: Helps trace knowledge flow step by step.  \n",
    "- **For presentations**: The visualization makes it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand the graph logic.  \n",
    "- **For analysis**: Edge weights and node labels provide context for why a certain path was chosen.\n",

    "### Explanation of the `GraphRAG` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GraphRAG` class is a high-level orchestrator that ties together all the components needed to build a **graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system**. Instead of only relying on vector similarity search (like vanilla RAG), it also builds a **knowledge graph** from documents, enabling more structured reasoning, path traversal, and visualization of how the system derives answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔑 Key Responsibilities of `GraphRAG`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**  \n",
    "   - **LLM (`ChatOpenAI`)**: The large language model used for generating responses, extracting relationships, and reasoning over graph nodes.  \n",
    "   - **Embedding model (`OpenAIEmbeddings`)**: Transforms document chunks into dense vectors for similarity search.  \n",
    "   - **Document Processor (`DocumentProcessor`)**: Handles chunking of documents and creation of embeddings/vector store.  \n",
    "   - **Knowledge Graph (`KnowledgeGraph`)**: Builds a structured graph of entities and relationships extracted from the documents.  \n",
    "   - **Query Engine (`QueryEngine`)**: Handles the process of interpreting queries, retrieving information from both the vector store and the knowledge graph, and producing a final answer. Initially set to `None` until documents are processed.  \n",
    "   - **Visualizer (`Visualizer`)**: Generates visual representations of how the query traversed the graph, showing the reasoning path.\n",
    "\n",
    "   👉 Under the hood: At this stage, the system is just setting up its \"tools\" but hasn’t yet ingested any documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Documents (`process_documents`)**  \n",
    "   - Splits the raw documents into manageable chunks using the `DocumentProcessor`.  \n",
    "   - Creates embeddings and stores them in a **FAISS vector store** for fast similarity search.  \n",
    "   - Builds a **knowledge graph** where nodes represent entities/concepts and edges represent relationships between them (extracted using the LLM).  \n",
    "   - Instantiates the `QueryEngine`, which knows how to combine vector retrieval + graph traversal for answering queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "   👉 Under the hood: This step converts **unstructured text** into two structured representations:  \n",
    "   - **Vector space** (good for fuzzy semantic similarity).  \n",
    "   - **Graph structure** (good for explicit reasoning and connections).  \n",
    "\n",
    "   By maintaining both, the system gains **breadth (semantic coverage)** and **depth (logical reasoning through graph paths)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Handling (`query`)**  \n",
    "   - Accepts a user query as input.  \n",
    "   - Passes it to the `QueryEngine`, which:  \n",
    "     - Retrieves semantically similar chunks from the vector store.  \n",
    "     - Explores the knowledge graph to find connected entities/paths that might be relevant.  \n",
    "     - Combines this evidence to generate a final response with the LLM.  \n",
    "   - Collects additional outputs:  \n",
    "     - **Traversal Path**: The sequence of nodes/edges the system followed in the graph.  \n",
    "     - **Filtered Content**: Subset of document chunks most relevant to the query.  \n",
    "   - If a traversal path exists, calls the `Visualizer` to plot the graph traversal, making the reasoning explainable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   👉 Under the hood: This is where the **RAG pipeline activates** — the system fuses vector-based recall with graph-based reasoning. Instead of being a black-box LLM response, you can **see the path** of how the system reasoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Why This Design?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Store Only (Vanilla RAG)**: Great for retrieving relevant chunks but limited in reasoning over structured relationships.  \n",
    "- **Graph Only**: Great for explicit knowledge reasoning but brittle if the graph misses relevant details.  \n",
    "- **Graph + Vector Hybrid (GraphRAG)**: Combines the **flexibility of embeddings** with the **structure of graphs**, allowing:  \n",
    "  - Better retrieval quality.  \n",
    "  - Explainability (graph traversal path).  \n",
    "  - Structured knowledge grounding.  \n",

    "## 📘 Summary & Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the excellent open-source repository [RAG_Techniques by NirDiamant](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques).  \n",
    "I referred to that work to understand how the pipeline is structured and then reimplemented the same concept in a **fully self-contained** way, but using recent models — as part of my personal learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I’ve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I’ve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook — explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline. It’s designed to help anyone (including my future self) grasp the **how** and the **why**, not just the **what**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Why Use Graph-Based Retrieval in RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional vector retrieval focuses only on semantic similarity between chunks.  \n",
    "While effective, it often misses **relationships between concepts** that span multiple chunks or documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Graph-Based Retrieval** addresses this by:  \n",
    "- 🧩 Capturing **entities and relationships** (knowledge graph) from documents  \n",
    "- 🔗 Allowing **multi-hop reasoning** across connected concepts  \n",
    "- 🎯 Providing more **contextually coherent answers** by traversing related nodes  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What’s New in This Version?\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation includes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧱 A **GraphRAG class** that integrates LLM, embeddings, document processing, graph building, querying, and visualization  \n",
    "- 📚 **KnowledgeGraph** to represent documents as nodes & edges (entities + relationships)  \n",
    "- 🔍 **QueryEngine** that combines vector search with graph traversal for enriched retrieval  \n",
    "- 🎨 **Visualizer** to display traversal paths, making reasoning transparent  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Inferences & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Ideal for domains with **interconnected facts** (research papers, legal docs, technical manuals)  \n",
    "- 🧠 Goes beyond *chunk-level similarity* by **reasoning over structured relationships**  \n",
    "- ⚡ Adds interpretability with traversal visualization (you can see “how” the model answered)  \n",
    "- 🔍 Bridges the gap between **unstructured text** and **structured reasoning**  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What Could Be Added Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 Evaluate GraphRAG vs. pure vector retrieval on **accuracy and hallucination reduction**  \n",
    "- 🧪 Extend to **hybrid retrieval** (graph + BM25 + embeddings) for robustness  \n",
    "- 🔗 Support **temporal or causal edges** (not just entity links)  \n",
    "- 🧠 Add **fallback to global retrieval** if graph traversal fails to find an answer  \n",
    "- ⚙️ Explore **graph algorithms** (PageRank, centrality) to prioritize influential nodes  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Final Word\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of my larger personal project: **RAG100x** — a challenge to build and log my journney in RAG from 0 100 in the coming months.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not built to impress — it’s built to **progress**.  \n",
    "Everything here is structured to enable **daily iteration**, focused experimentation, and clean documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're exploring RAG from first principles, feel free to use this as a scaffold for your own builds. And of course — check out the original repository for broader implementations and ideas."
