    "## 🔁 **Query Transformations for Smarter Retrieval** | **RAG100X**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores how transforming user queries can dramatically improve the quality of retrieval in RAG systems. Instead of relying only on the original (often vague or complex) query, we use LLMs to rewrite, broaden, or break it down — helping the retriever fetch **more accurate and complete results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Key Techniques Covered**\n",
    "We build and test three query transformation strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Rewriting** → Makes vague queries more specific  \n",
    "- **Step-back Prompting** → Broadens narrow queries for better context  \n",
    "- **Sub-query Decomposition** → Splits complex queries into simpler ones\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transformed query is run through a retriever to compare against the original, helping us analyze which method gives the most useful chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🛠️ **Why this matters in production:**  \n",
    "In real-world RAG systems (e.g., customer support or legal research), users often ask unclear or overloaded questions. These techniques help reframe the query behind the scenes — so your system doesn’t miss critical documents or generate half-baked answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a legal chatbot asked *\"What did the 2022 ruling say about tax law in California?\"* might miss key background. But a **step-back prompt** like *\"What are the major 2022 tax rulings in California?\"* ensures broader, more relevant context gets retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 **How This Fits into RAG100X**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, RAG100x has covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PDF-based document QA  \n",
    "2. CSV-based retrieval from structured data  \n",
    "3. Blog-based RAG with hallucination checks  \n",
    "4. Chunk-size tuning for better retrieval  \n",
    "5. Propositional chunking for precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in **Day 6**, we shift focus from *what* you retrieve to *how* you ask for it. Query transformation is a lightweight, modular layer you can add to almost any RAG system — and it works especially well when users submit complex or ambiguous inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Think of this as upgrading the \"search intent\" of your RAG — so your system starts from a better question, not just a better index.\n"

    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the excellent open-source repository [RAG_Techniques by NirDiamant](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques).  \n",
    "I referred to that work to understand how the pipeline is structured and then reimplemented the same concept in a **fully self-contained** way, but using recent models — as part of my personal learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I’ve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I’ve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook — explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline. It’s designed to help anyone (including my future self) grasp the **how** and the **why**, not just the **what**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Why Improve Queries in RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most RAG pipelines focus on chunking and retrieval, but **query quality is the real first bottleneck**. Poorly phrased queries lead to irrelevant or incomplete results — even if your chunks and embeddings are perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores **three advanced query transformation techniques** to supercharge retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✍️ **Query Rewriting** — Refines vague queries into better-formed, search-optimized versions\n",
    "- 🔁 **Step-back Prompting** — Adds background context by generating broader, higher-level queries\n",
    "- 🧩 **Sub-query Decomposition** — Splits complex queries into smaller, atomic sub-queries for multi-hop retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method is:\n",
    "- Powered by **GPT-4o via LangChain**\n",
    "- Implemented as **modular, reusable LLM chains**\n",
    "- Tested on the *Understanding Climate Change* dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🧠 What’s New in This Version?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to earlier RAG builds, this version focuses on **query-centric improvements**, offering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 **LLM-first pre-retrieval transformation** — Enhance queries *before* sending them to the retriever  \n",
    "- 🎯 **Custom prompt templates** — Fine-tuned instructions for consistent, high-quality output  \n",
    "- 🧪 **Chainable logic** — Each transformation is self-contained and composable with other RAG tools  \n",
    "- 🧼 **Production-friendly design** — No reliance on external modules, all logic lives inside the notebook for easy reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "This design philosophy enables **plug-and-play enhancements** for production-grade retrieval systems.\n",

    "## 📈 Inferences & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "From running the transformations on real examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔍 **Rewriting consistently improves keyword alignment**, making FAISS and Chroma retrievals more relevant  \n",
    "- 🌐 **Step-back prompting adds essential context** — especially for under-specified or abstract queries  \n",
    "- 🧩 **Sub-query decomposition boosts completeness** — great for multi-hop or reasoning-heavy questions  \n",
    "- 📊 Overall, combining these techniques leads to **higher-quality retrieval inputs**, which translate into **more accurate, grounded LLM outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What Could Be Added Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "To evolve this system into a full production-ready layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🔁 **Evaluate each method automatically** — Use LLM graders to compare retrieval relevance and answer faithfulness across transformed queries  \n",
    "- 🧠 **Train a lightweight transformer rewriter** — Fine-tune a small model (e.g. DistilBERT) on rewritten vs. original queries for offline use  \n",
    "- 🔌 **Plug into real retrievers** — Connect to Elastic, Weaviate, or pgvector to observe improvements at scale  \n",
    "- 📊 **Add scoring dashboards** — Track how each transformation impacts hit rate, relevancy, and latency  \n",
