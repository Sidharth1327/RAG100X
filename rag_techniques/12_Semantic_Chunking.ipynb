    "## 🧠 Semantic Chunking for Coherent Retrieval | RAG100X\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Semantic Chunking** — a technique that intelligently splits documents at **meaningful breakpoints**, resulting in **context-preserving chunks** for downstream LLM retrieval and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional chunking (e.g., every 500 characters), semantic chunking leverages **embedding-based similarity** to detect where ideas naturally begin and end — leading to more coherent text segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result? Chunks that reflect complete thoughts, better retrieval alignment, and answers that actually make sense in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What You’ll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why fixed-size chunking often breaks up sentences mid-thought  \n",
    "- How to use LangChain’s `SemanticChunker` to split by semantic shifts  \n",
    "- The difference between percentile, standard deviation, and IQR breakpoints  \n",
    "- How OpenAI embeddings guide both chunking and retrieval  \n",
    "- Why semantically coherent chunks boost RAG performance  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Real-world Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine splitting a novel into chunks every 200 words — you’d likely cut across scenes, dialogues, or even mid-sentence.  \n",
    "Now imagine chunking where the **story naturally pauses** — at paragraph ends, chapter breaks, or scene changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Semantic Chunking works like that — using embeddings to find conceptual \"jumps\" between sentences and split there.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 How Semantic Chunking Works Under the Hood\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step                        | What Happens                                                                 |\n",
    "|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| 1. PDF Extraction           | The full PDF is converted into a raw text string                            |\n",
    "| 2. Sentence Embeddings      | Each sentence is converted into an OpenAI embedding vector                   |\n",
    "| 3. Semantic Distance Calc   | The system computes differences between adjacent sentence embeddings         |\n",
    "| 4. Breakpoint Detection     | When a distance exceeds a threshold (e.g., 90th percentile), a split occurs  |\n",
    "| 5. Chunk Assembly           | Sentences between breakpoints are grouped into coherent chunks               |\n",
    "| 6. Embedding & Indexing     | Chunks are embedded again and stored in a FAISS vector store                 |\n",
    "| 7. Query & Retrieval        | Queries are matched against these semantic chunks using vector similarity    |\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 This process ensures each chunk contains a **complete idea**, reducing the risk of retrieving incomplete or confusing fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Why This Works So Well\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✂️ **No arbitrary cutoffs**: Chunks are split where semantic shifts actually happen  \n",
    "- 🧩 **Improved coherence**: Each chunk is likely to contain a full concept or argument  \n",
    "- 🔍 **Better retrieval**: Embedding-aligned chunks match query intent more precisely  \n",
    "- 🤖 **LLM-friendly**: Language models handle semantically rich text better than fragmented ones  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Why This Matters in Production\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed-size chunks often lead to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Mid-sentence breaks  \n",
    "- ❌ Fragmented ideas  \n",
    "- ❌ Poor retrieval quality  \n",
    "\n",
    "But with semantic chunking, imagine retrieving this instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Climate change is primarily driven by greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO₂ from fossil fuels. This has been confirmed by decades of atmospheric research.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Complete idea. Self-contained. Easy to ground an answer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the power of semantic chunking — giving your RAG system **intelligent building blocks** to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Where This Fits in RAG100X\n",

    "### ⚙️ Breakpoint Strategies in Semantic Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of semantic chunking lies the decision of **where to split**. Unlike arbitrary character counts, this method relies on **semantic distances** — the difference in meaning between neighboring sentences, measured using their embedding vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain’s `SemanticChunker` offers three strategies for identifying these semantic breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'percentile'`: Calculate all pairwise sentence distances. Split where the distance exceeds the Xth percentile (e.g., top 10% most abrupt meaning shifts).\n",
    "- `'standard_deviation'`: Identify sentence pairs whose semantic gap is X standard deviations above the mean.\n",
    "- `'interquartile'`: Use the interquartile range (IQR) of distances. Sentences beyond this typical range are considered \"semantic jumps\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this mean?**  \n",
    "➡️ *“Split the text where semantic difference between adjacent sentences falls in the top 10% of all differences.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What Happens Under the Hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentence Splitting**  \n",
    "   The document is first broken down into individual sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Sentences**  \n",
    "   Each sentence is converted into a high-dimensional vector using OpenAI’s embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Semantic Distance**  \n",
    "   For every pair of adjacent sentences, a semantic distance (typically cosine distance) is calculated.  \n",
    "   These distances measure how much the meaning changes from one sentence to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Detect Breakpoints**  \n",
    "   The splitter identifies points where the semantic shift is in the **top 10%** of all measured shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chunk Formation**  \n",
    "   Sentences between these breakpoints are grouped into coherent chunks, preserving the flow of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of reading a textbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, ideas flow smoothly — one sentence builds on the last.\n",
    "- Other times, there’s a **clear topic shift** — like a new section, concept, or argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic distances act like a \"topic change detector.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a big enough shift occurs, it’s as if the algorithm says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🛑 *\"Okay, time to start a new paragraph.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking uses **vector math instead of intuition** to create chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fewer, broader chunks:** Use a higher threshold (e.g., 95th percentile).\n",
    "- **Finer-grained splits:** Use a lower threshold (e.g., 75th percentile).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Group sentences into logically self-contained chunks that preserve meaning — ideal for retrieval and generation in RAG systems.**\n"

    "I referred to that work to understand how the pipeline is structured and then reimplemented the same concept in a **fully self-contained** way, but using recent models — as part of my personal learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I’ve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I’ve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook — explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline.

    "- 📦 End-to-end pipeline from PDF → semantic chunks → retriever  \n",
