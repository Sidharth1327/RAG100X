    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Semantic Chunking** ‚Äî a technique that intelligently splits documents at **meaningful breakpoints**, resulting in **context-preserving chunks** for downstream LLM retrieval and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional chunking (e.g., every 500 characters), semantic chunking leverages **embedding-based similarity** to detect where ideas naturally begin and end ‚Äî leading to more coherent text segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result? Chunks that reflect complete thoughts, better retrieval alignment, and answers that actually make sense in context.\n",

    "Imagine splitting a novel into chunks every 200 words ‚Äî you‚Äôd likely cut across scenes, dialogues, or even mid-sentence.  \n",
    "Now imagine chunking where the **story naturally pauses** ‚Äî at paragraph ends, chapter breaks, or scene changes.\n",

    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Breakpoint Strategies in Semantic Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of semantic chunking lies the decision of **where to split**. Unlike arbitrary character counts, this method relies on **semantic distances** ‚Äî the difference in meaning between neighboring sentences, measured using their embedding vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain‚Äôs `SemanticChunker` offers three strategies for identifying these semantic breakpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'percentile'`: Calculate all pairwise sentence distances. Split where the distance exceeds the Xth percentile (e.g., top 10% most abrupt meaning shifts).\n",
    "- `'standard_deviation'`: Identify sentence pairs whose semantic gap is X standard deviations above the mean.\n",
    "- `'interquartile'`: Use the interquartile range (IQR) of distances. Sentences beyond this typical range are considered \"semantic jumps\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does this mean?**  \n",
    "‚û°Ô∏è *‚ÄúSplit the text where semantic difference between adjacent sentences falls in the top 10% of all differences.‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† What Happens Under the Hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentence Splitting**  \n",
    "   The document is first broken down into individual sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Sentences**  \n",
    "   Each sentence is converted into a high-dimensional vector using OpenAI‚Äôs embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Semantic Distance**  \n",
    "   For every pair of adjacent sentences, a semantic distance (typically cosine distance) is calculated.  \n",
    "   These distances measure how much the meaning changes from one sentence to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Detect Breakpoints**  \n",
    "   The splitter identifies points where the semantic shift is in the **top 10%** of all measured shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chunk Formation**  \n",
    "   Sentences between these breakpoints are grouped into coherent chunks, preserving the flow of ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìö Simple Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of reading a textbook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes, ideas flow smoothly ‚Äî one sentence builds on the last.\n",
    "- Other times, there‚Äôs a **clear topic shift** ‚Äî like a new section, concept, or argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic distances act like a \"topic change detector.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "When a big enough shift occurs, it‚Äôs as if the algorithm says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> üõë *\"Okay, time to start a new paragraph.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic chunking uses **vector math instead of intuition** to create chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fewer, broader chunks:** Use a higher threshold (e.g., 95th percentile).\n",
    "- **Finer-grained splits:** Use a lower threshold (e.g., 75th percentile).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ The Goal\n",

    "I referred to that work to understand how the pipeline is structured and then reimplemented the same concept in a **fully self-contained** way, but using recent models ‚Äî as part of my personal learning journey.\n",

    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I‚Äôve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I‚Äôve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook ‚Äî explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline.

    "## üí° Final Word\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of my larger personal project: **RAG100x** ‚Äî a challenge to build and log my journney in RAG from 0 100 in the coming months.\n",
