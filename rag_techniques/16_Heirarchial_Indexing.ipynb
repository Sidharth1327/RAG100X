    "\n",
    "This notebook implements **Hierarchical Indexing** — a retrieval strategy designed to reflect the **multi-level structure** of complex content (like documents, chapters, sections) and perform **multi-stage retrieval** that mirrors human information search patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than treating all chunks equally, hierarchical indexing helps navigate large knowledge bases **top-down** — from high-level summaries to fine-grained details — improving both **precision and relevance**.\n",

    "- How to use **two-stage retrieval**: first coarse-grained, then fine-grained  \n",
    "- How to integrate **LangChain retrievers** to query across hierarchical levels  \n",
    "- When hierarchical indexing is better than flat vector search  \n",

    "- 💬 **Better context windows**: Reduces irrelevant token bloat for LLMs  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Use Cases Where It Shines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long documents (e.g., research papers, policy manuals)  \n",
    "- Websites or blogs with structured layouts (e.g., guides, FAQs)  \n",
    "- Legal or financial documents with nested hierarchies  \n",
    "- Any scenario where context granularity improves retrieval quality  \n",

    "### 🔄 Where This Fits in RAG100X\n",

    "1. Flat retrieval systems with vector stores  \n",
    "2. Query and context enrichment techniques (HyDE, CEW, Sub-query Decomp)  \n",

    "\n",
    "Here’s a step-by-step explanation of what the function `encode_pdf_hierarchical()` does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **📄 Load PDF pages**:\n",
    "   - If `is_string=False`, it loads from a real PDF file using `PyPDFLoader`.\n",
    "   - If `is_string=True`, it assumes the input is raw text (used for testing/debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **📝 Summarize Each Page**:\n",
    "   - Uses **GPT-4o-mini** to generate a concise summary of each page.\n",
    "   - Handles API rate limits using **exponential backoff** and batching to stay compliant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **🧩 Create Detailed Chunks**:\n",
    "   - Uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to break each page into overlapping chunks.\n",
    "   - Adds metadata like chunk index and page number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **🔗 Embed Both Levels**:\n",
    "   - Summaries and chunks are embedded **separately** using `OpenAIEmbeddings`.\n",
    "   - Two **FAISS vector stores** are created in parallel:\n",
    "     - One for summaries\n",
    "     - One for chunks"

    "## 🔁 Retry with Exponential Backoff | Rate Limit Resilience for Async Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "In production RAG pipelines, API rate limits are a common bottleneck — especially when using services like OpenAI. A **rate limit error** occurs when you send too many requests in a short period, and the server tells you to slow down.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this gracefully, we implement a **retry strategy with exponential backoff**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 What is Exponential Backoff?\n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential backoff means:  \n",
    "> *“Wait a little longer after each failed attempt before retrying — and double the wait time each time.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps reduce the pressure on the server and increases the chance of a successful retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example retry delays:  \n",
    "1st retry → wait 1s  \n",
    "2nd retry → wait 2s  \n",
    "3rd retry → wait 4s  \n",
    "... and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Function Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `retry_with_exponential_backoff(coroutine)` wraps **any async coroutine** (e.g. calling OpenAI, summarization, embedding) and retries it if it hits a `RateLimitError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ It tries multiple times (default 5).\n",
    "- 🧠 After each failure, it waits longer before retrying (exponentially).\n",
    "- 🛑 If all retries fail, it raises the last exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes your system **more reliable** and protects against temporary spikes in API usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Why Async?\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is `async` so it can `await` both:\n",
    "- The coroutine you're running.\n",
    "- The pause/wait time using `await asyncio.sleep(...)` inside `exponential_backoff()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial in concurrent systems — so you **don’t block** the event loop while waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Usage Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're summarizing documents using OpenAI's API:\n",

    "## 📘 Summary & Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the excellent open-source repository [RAG_Techniques by NirDiamant](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques).  \n",
    "I referred to that work to understand how the pipeline is structured and then reimplemented the same concept in a **fully self-contained** way, but using recent models — as part of my personal learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I’ve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I’ve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook — explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline. It’s designed to help anyone (including my future self) grasp the **how** and the **why**, not just the **what**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Why Use Hierarchical Retrieval in RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "In large or structured documents, querying the entire corpus at once often retrieves contextually scattered results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Retrieval** addresses this by:\n",
    "- 🧭 First identifying **relevant regions** (via summaries or TOC-level units)  \n",
    "- 🔎 Then performing **focused retrieval** within those regions  \n",
    "- 🧹 Reducing noise from irrelevant sections, even if semantically similar  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What’s New in This Version?\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧱 Two-level vectorstores — one for **summaries**, one for **detailed chunks**  \n",
    "- 🗂️ Metadata-based filtering to align chunks with their summary’s **page number**  \n",
    "- 🔁 A hierarchical flow: *summaries ➝ filtered detailed chunks*  \n",
    "- 🔌 Easily integrable into LangChain or standalone RAG pipelines  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Inferences & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Ideal for **lengthy PDFs, multi-topic reports, or research papers**  \n",
    "- 🧠 Mimics how humans search — *skim first, deep dive later*  \n",
    "- ⚡ Reduces unnecessary token usage and LLM context pollution  \n",
    "- 🔍 Encourages **targeted grounding**, improving factual consistency in generation  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What Could Be Added Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 Evaluate impact on **faithfulness and hallucination rates**  \n",
    "- 🧪 Extend filtering to **multi-field metadata** (e.g., section, chapter)  \n",
    "- 🔗 Combine with reranking (e.g., **CrossEncoder**) for even tighter precision  \n",
    "- 🧠 Add fallback to global retrieval if summaries fail to locate answers  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Final Word\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of my larger personal project: **RAG100x** — a challenge to build and log my journney in RAG from 0 100 in the coming months.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not built to impress — it’s built to **progress**.  \n",
    "Everything here is structured to enable **daily iteration**, focused experimentation, and clean documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're exploring RAG from first principles, feel free to use this as a scaffold for your own builds. And of course — check out the original repository for broader implementations and ideas."
