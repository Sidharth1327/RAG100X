    "\n",
    "#### 1. `CrossEncoder.predict()` is a Synchronous, CPU/GPU-bound Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `predict()` method from the ü§ó `sentence-transformers` library is a **blocking**, CPU/GPU-intensive operation.\n",
    "- It does **not have an async version** like `await cross_encoder.apredict(...)` ‚Äî such a method doesn‚Äôt exist.\n",
    "- This is because the model runs **locally on your machine** and performs **matrix computations**, not I/O operations (e.g., API calls, file reads, or DB queries).\n",
    "- As a result, using async would **not provide any performance gain** ‚Äî it would still block the CPU while executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. LangChain Supports Both Sync and Async Retriever Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides two interfaces for custom retrievers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_relevant_documents(query: str)` ‚Üí **Synchronous**\n",
    "- `aget_relevant_documents(query: str)` ‚Üí **Asynchronous**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we only define the **synchronous version** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both the **vectorstore** and **CrossEncoder model** are synchronous.\n",
    "- Async is only helpful when dealing with **I/O-bound tasks**, such as:\n",
    "  - Calling OpenAI or Groq LLM APIs\n",
    "  - Querying remote vector databases\n",
    "  - Fetching data from external APIs or files\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don‚Äôt implement `aget_relevant_documents()` because there's **no async benefit** ‚Äî our reranking pipeline is **fully local and CPU-bound**.\n",
    "- If needed, you *can* add an async wrapper using `asyncio.run_in_executor(...)`, but that‚Äôs mainly useful in **web server contexts** (like FastAPI apps).\n"

    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I‚Äôve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I‚Äôve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook ‚Äî explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline. It‚Äôs designed to help anyone (including my future self) grasp the **how** and the **why**, not just the **what**.\n",

    "- üßπ Filtering out semantically close but contextually irrelevant chunks  \n",

    "- üîÅ Initial recall with **FAISS vectorstore**, followed by CrossEncoder reranking  \n",
    "- üßÆ **Local reranking** using `sentence-transformers` without external API calls  \n",
    "- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable `k` and `rerank_top_k` for control over retrieval and precision  \n",

    "- üß© Easily pluggable into LangChain‚Äôs `RetrievalQA` pipeline  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ What Could Be Added Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìä Evaluate the impact of reranking using faithfulness and relevancy metrics  \n",
    "- üß™ Compare performance vs. embedding-only retrievers like HyDE or HyPE  \n",
    "- üîó Try **Hybrid Fusion + Reranking** for improved recall *and* precision  \n",
    "- üåç Serve CrossEncoder via a lightweight API for use in web apps or agents  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Final Word\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of my larger personal project: **RAG100x** ‚Äî a challenge to build and log my journney in RAG from 0 100 in the coming months.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs not built to impress ‚Äî it‚Äôs built to **progress**.  \n",
    "Everything here is structured to enable **daily iteration**, focused experimentation, and clean documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're exploring RAG from first principles, feel free to use this as a scaffold for your own builds. And of course ‚Äî check out the original repository for broader implementations and ideas."
