    "### ⚙️ Why We Only Implemented the Synchronous Retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `CrossEncoder.predict()` is a Synchronous, CPU/GPU-bound Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `predict()` method from the 🤗 `sentence-transformers` library is a **blocking**, CPU/GPU-intensive operation.\n",
    "- It does **not have an async version** like `await cross_encoder.apredict(...)` — such a method doesn’t exist.\n",
    "- This is because the model runs **locally on your machine** and performs **matrix computations**, not I/O operations (e.g., API calls, file reads, or DB queries).\n",
    "- As a result, using async would **not provide any performance gain** — it would still block the CPU while executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. LangChain Supports Both Sync and Async Retriever Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides two interfaces for custom retrievers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_relevant_documents(query: str)` → **Synchronous**\n",
    "- `aget_relevant_documents(query: str)` → **Asynchronous**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, we only define the **synchronous version** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both the **vectorstore** and **CrossEncoder model** are synchronous.\n",
    "- Async is only helpful when dealing with **I/O-bound tasks**, such as:\n",
    "  - Calling OpenAI or Groq LLM APIs\n",
    "  - Querying remote vector databases\n",
    "  - Fetching data from external APIs or files\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don’t implement `aget_relevant_documents()` because there's **no async benefit** — our reranking pipeline is **fully local and CPU-bound**.\n",
    "- If needed, you *can* add an async wrapper using `asyncio.run_in_executor(...)`, but that’s mainly useful in **web server contexts** (like FastAPI apps).\n"

    "2. **Creating a `RetrievalQA` chain with a GPT-4o LLM**\n",
    "3. **Running a sample query to see reranked results**\n",

    "- A `vectorstore` for initial retrieval\n",
    "- A `cross_encoder` model for reranking\n",
    "- `k=10` — Retrieve 10 documents initially from the vectorstore\n",

    "This notebook is based on the excellent open-source repository [RAG_Techniques by NirDiamant](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques).  \n",
    "I referred to that work to understand how the pipeline is structured and then reimplemented the same concept in a **fully self-contained** way, but using recent models — as part of my personal learning journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is purely **educational**:  \n",
    "- To deepen my understanding of Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems  \n",
    "- To keep a clean, trackable log of what I’ve built and learned  \n",
    "- And to serve as a future reference for myself or others starting from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "To support that, I’ve added clear, concise markdowns throughout the notebook — explaining *why* each package was installed, *why* each line of code exists, and *how* each component fits into the overall RAG pipeline. It’s designed to help anyone (including my future self) grasp the **how** and the **why**, not just the **what**.\n",

    "## 🔍 Why Use Cross-Encoder Reranking in RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector similarity retrieval is fast but imprecise — it only considers embeddings, not the actual query-token alignment.\n",

    "**Cross-Encoder Reranking** upgrades your RAG pipeline by:\n",
    "- 🧠 Performing **deep pairwise comparison** between query and each candidate document  \n",

    "- 🧹 Filtering out semantically close but contextually irrelevant chunks  \n",

    "- 🔁 Initial recall with **FAISS vectorstore**, followed by CrossEncoder reranking  \n",
    "- 🧮 **Local reranking** using `sentence-transformers` without external API calls  \n",
    "- ⚙️ Configurable `k` and `rerank_top_k` for control over retrieval and precision  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Inferences & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Cross-encoders significantly **improve retrieval precision** by modeling query-doc interactions  \n",
    "- 🧠 Best used when you need **fewer but highly relevant chunks**  \n",
    "- ⚡ Reranking is CPU/GPU-bound — great for small-to-mid-sized corpora  \n",
    "- 🧩 Easily pluggable into LangChain’s `RetrievalQA` pipeline  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 What Could Be Added Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📊 Evaluate the impact of reranking using faithfulness and relevancy metrics  \n",
    "- 🧪 Compare performance vs. embedding-only retrievers like HyDE or HyPE  \n",
    "- 🔗 Try **Hybrid Fusion + Reranking** for improved recall *and* precision  \n",
    "- 🌍 Serve CrossEncoder via a lightweight API for use in web apps or agents  \n",

    "## 💡 Final Word\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of my larger personal project: **RAG100x** — a challenge to build and log my journney in RAG from 0 100 in the coming months.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not built to impress — it’s built to **progress**.  \n",
    "Everything here is structured to enable **daily iteration**, focused experimentation, and clean documentation.\n",
